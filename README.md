This project report outlines the development of an Android application designed to organize and manage events within a university or organization. The app features real-time tracking of sports grounds for six different sports, provides information on societies, and displays upcoming trips and seminars. It also includes a central hub for detailed information on major events. The application is exclusive to affiliated members and offers paid membership details for facilities like the gym, swimming pool, and horse riding.
